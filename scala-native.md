# Why would you use scala native ?

Advantages of system programming:

- Faster startup
- Use c libraries
- Closer to metal
- Low level memory allocation / IO 

Advantages of scala:

- Functional programming
- Reuse of scala libraries (need to be published for native)
- Use of Scala tooling (sbt, intellij)


# C Interoperability 

# C++ / Objective-C / Swift Interoperability

# kotlin

# vs rust

Differences

- Opinionate approach to memory management (statically verified) vs garbage collector.
- Wider ecosystem (wider libraries and adoption on rust)

Similarities

- Favour functional programming
- Powerful type system (see differences)

# vs golang

Differences

- Super simple type system and language design overall (no generics, weird error handling)
